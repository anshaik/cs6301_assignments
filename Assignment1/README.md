Assignment 1
Due Date: January 29, 2015
=============================================

Part 1 - Create your personal homepage
Create your personal homepage  (file should be named index.html) and upload it to utdallas.edu. Instructions for uploading process are provided below.
The web page should contain legitimate information about you (background information, hobbies, interests etc.)  and should not contain any HTML code that is generated by a web design tool (FrontPage, PageMaker, and etc. )
In your page’s HTML, make sure to include following elements.
- <p>
- <ul> : Set all bulleted lists of items on the page to use an image for their bullet icon rather than the normal black circle
- <table>
- <img>
- <a>
- <meta> for description of your web page
- <meta> for the keywords associated with your page

* See notes section for page layout

=============================================

Part 2 – Add style to your page

Add a CSS file called index.css to your webpage. Make the following changes and additions to your index.html file:

1. Add a photograph of yourself and float it to the left side of a paragraph using CSS. The paragraph can include short information about yourself. Add border and margins to the image.

2. Change the font used throughout the document to sans-serif. 

3. Center the heading with your name in it.

4. Setup your links to use the “:hover” pseudo-class (use a:hover so that only the links are effected). How the link changes when the mouse moves on top of it is up to you, but if you’re short on ideas, just have the link change colors.

5. Add <span> tags and setup your style sheet so that every time the word “UTD” appears, it is in “red” and is in bold.

6. When the user hovers the mouse over the word “UTD”, full university name should appear as a tooltip.

7. Define sections (div) for your webpage and apply different styling rules to different sections. (Remember: sections of same “class” can have the same style)

8. Set your home page to have a "favorites icon" ("favicon"). Use absolute URLs to link to the image file. (The icon may not work in Internet Explorer; you may ignore this.)

Notes:
1. Webpages should be laid out using CSS floats (no HTML tables or CSS absolute positioning). This has not been covered in the lecture; you will have to explore online resources to learn how to do this. (i.e. http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_float.asp) 

2. For full credit, your pages must pass the W3C HTML and CSS validator with no errors (a green bar). Choose appropriate HTML tags to match the structure of the content on the page. Do not express style information in HTML with inline styles or presentational HTML tags such as b or font.

Use following sites for validation of your pages:
http://validator.w3.org/ (for HTML)
http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator (for CSS)

3. Your files should work on both the latest version of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. You will not be tested in Microsoft Internet Explorer or other browsers that do not comply to web standards.

Instructions for setting up a web page
You can find these steps also at http://www.utdallas.edu/ir/howto/personal-webpage/
To set up your homepage, perform following steps:

1.	Get a NetID. You can set it up in the Student Microcomputer Labs or at http://netid.utdallas.edu.
2.	Launch an SSH client such as Putty. 
3.	Type giant.utdallas.edu into the Host Name field and select the SSH circle below. Click Yes at the following notice window.
4.	Enter your netid and password when prompted.
5.	Type makeweb, then press enter. Do not close Putty.
6.	Place your index.html file in your home directory’s public_html folder, called your H: drive in the Labs (ask a Computer Assistant if you need help accessing it).  Alternatively, you can use an FTP program (i.e. FireFTP for Mozilla Firefox, WinSCP) to upload your files to your home directory.
7.	Go back to Putty and type cd public_html to get to your personal web space.
8.	Ensure that you are in the public_html directory and type chmod 755 index.html, then enter.
9.	For all subsequent pages you wish to add, it is required that you type chmod 755 filename.html (where filename.html is the directory and the name of your webpage), as this will set read and write permissions for each page.
10.	Your homepage should then be accessible as http://www.utdallas.edu/~netid.
11.	For further assistance, contact the Help Desk at 972-883-2911 or assist@utdallas.edu. 
You will automatically be added to the list of personal homepages the following day.
